Movie Recommendation App

The Movie Recommendation App is a simple web-based application designed to provide users with a Netflix-style movie browsing experience. It allows users to explore a collection of movies, search by title, and mark their favorite movies using a like button. The project demonstrates how movie data can be filtered and displayed dynamically using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This app’s layout and theme are inspired by popular streaming platforms like Netflix and MX Player, offering a clean, responsive interface that’s easy to navigate. The app can serve as the foundation for more advanced recommendation systems using machine learning or APIs such as TMDB (The Movie Database).
